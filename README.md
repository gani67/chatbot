# chatbot
The chatbot greets the user.
It listens for user input in an infinite loop.
It checks the user's message using a series of if, elif, and else conditions.
Based on the message, it responds accordingly:
     It greets if the user says hello/hi.
     It tells its name if asked.
     tells the time if asked.
     It gives a friendly response to weather-related questions.
     It exits when the user says "bye."
If the user enters an unrecognized input, it gives a default response.
